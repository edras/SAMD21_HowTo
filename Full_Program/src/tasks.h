/*******************************************************************************
 *  Task scheduler module for loose real time control of tasks
 *
 *  Company:
 *    Microchip Technology Inc.
 *
 *  File Name:
 *    tasks.h
 *
 *  Summary:
 *    Task functions to implement a task scheduler.
 *
 *  Description:
 *    Function to implement a simple task scheduler at "loose" real time. Loose
 *    real time means that there is no guarantee of real time operation. I.e.,
 *    in case some "task" blocks the task loop, other tasks will not get executed.
 *    It is a task of the programmer to ensure that no task will block.
 * 
 *  How to use this module:
 *    1. Call Task_synch each 1 ms
 *    2. Register the task at program beginning or when needed.
 *    3. Call Task_execute inside the main loop
 *    To register a task:
 *      a. define a delay to start the task. delay = 0 start task immediately.
 *      b. define a reload time to repeat the task. reload = 0 execute the task
 *         only once and the resources for the task are released.
 *      c. pass a function pointer with no parameter and now return as a task.
 *         i.e.: void doSomething(void)
 *      Example: execute doSomething immediately and repeat it each 50ms:
 *      - Task_register(0, 50, doSomething);
 *      Example: execute doSomething after 100 ms and repeat it each 200ms:
 *      - Task_register(100, 200, doSomething);
 *      Example: execute doSomething only once after 200 ms:
 *      - Task_register(200, 0, doSomething);
 *
